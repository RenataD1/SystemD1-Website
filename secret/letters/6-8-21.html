        <h2>Hey Nathan,</h2>
        
        <p>Just wanted to let you know that sometimes I think about killing myself. I was planning to tell you this yesterday while we were in front of school, when I mentioned the psychiatric appointment I was going to have later that afternoon. I chose not to actually say it because I didn't feel like making the conversation about me. Hence, I'm formally writing to you on Discord.</p>
        
        <p>These thoughts have been in my mind for a couple of years now; I've only just started to realize that they could actually put me at risk if unchecked for too long. This is why I went missing that one day in early February. It's a little blurry now, but I remember experiencing something like an episode of nonstop screaming in the bathroom, followed by immediate calmness. For the first time ever, I was scared for my life and sanity, unable to trust myself sitting alone in my own house. So I tried to escape to a nearby hospital where I could be protected from everything for just a day or two. Ultimately, I got ahold of my senses and went back home.
        </p>
        
        <p>This is also why I keep a YouTube channel with unlisted videos. I've shown it to you once before. It's a time capsule where I can dump any kind of video I want into a pile. I have it in case I want to die.</p>
        
        <p>But I've calmed down for now. I don't want to kill myself. Not at all. I want to be able to laugh at shit and listen to music. I want to form a band with my cousin and do computer science. I want to see the world and work towards the version of me I dream about in bed. I want the good ending, but I'm working against myself here. At this point, I realize that this is a battle between me and the person who wants to kill me.</p>
        
        <p>I'm telling you this while I still have a head on my shoulders because sooner or later, I might start thinking about death again. And I'll try to hide it if you confront me about it, tomorrow or whenever.</p>
        
        <p>The only thing I hope you can take from this is that I'm here to listen to you if you have your own problems. It can be something you think is stupid or something big but it doesn't matter. I won't always have the energy to look into myself like this, but I'll do my best not to turn down any questions you have to ask. I guess this is something you've already said to me way-back-when, but still. I sometimes feel like I don't know you nearly as well as I thought I did. I wonder if I ever even knew you at all. Consequently, I have grown to resent you the way one can resent a stranger. Sometimes, I hate you because I don't know shit about you. Or anyone.
        </p>
        <p>I'm not quite sure how you'll respond to this message, but please don't bend over backwards to try and cure me of my retardation. You don't have to respond to this message. You don't need to do anything. If you don't really get or want to deal with the things I'm saying, don't force yourself. All I have to look forward to tomorrow is a bike ride and maybe lunch with some friends.</p>
        
        <p>You can choose to keep this to yourself or not. I don't really care right now. I think I may be in good hands.</p>

    <span class="sidenote">
        So this is it, my first journal entry, in what might become a small bucket of other journal entries.
        I wrote this in my notes app two days ago, while I was getting an eye exam. 
        Picked out some gold raybans for my next pair of frames. 
        I was in a state of calmness, but aware that I might soon become suicidal again.
        I don't want to die, but I knew I needed to express that I might want to die in the future.
        So I thought to tell Nathan after telling my mom. In the end, I chose not to send this to him; it seemed a little to wordy and too long. 
        I didn't want to overwhelm him with paragraphs, so instead I texted him in real time, speaking from my heart.
        It was short and sweet, but not enough, I feel.
